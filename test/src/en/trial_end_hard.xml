    <string name="content"><![CDATA[Hi,

	It seems like KeepSafe Premium is not the right thing for you. We just want to let you know what happens next.

	KeepSafe will still works as you expect it to work. The only difference youâ€™ll find is that our Premium features are turned off. These include:

	* Album Lock
	* Fake PIN
	* Custom Album Covers
	* Secret Door
	* Break-In Alerts
	* PIN Timeout

	We reduced the amount of images that we keep for you in our Private Cloud to a maximum of 200 in your account.

	You can upgrade to KeepSafe Premium at any time, in case you decide later that you actually want to use some of these features.

	All the best  
	The KeepSafe Team]]></string>
