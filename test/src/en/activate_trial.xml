    <string name="content"><![CDATA[Congratulations!   
	Youâ€™ve unlocked a KeepSafe Premium feature and have begun a free trial.

	We just wanted to reach out to make sure that you know about all of our special features. These include:

	* **Fake PIN** - A second PIN that will lead you into a separate KeepSafe. Really handy when someone forces you to open KeepSafe.
	* **Secret Door** - Makes KeepSafe look like any other virus scanner. You need to hold on the logo to get to the PIN.
	* **Break-In Alerts** - Takes a picture of anyone trying to open your KeepSafe with the wrong PIN. Break-in Alerts will also lock your KeepSafe for a set time after multiple wrong attempts.
	* **PIN timeout** - Allows you to leave KeepSafe for 30 seconds without needing to re-enter you PIN.
	* **Private Cloud sync**  - Your KeepSafe Private Cloud now holds up to a 1000 photos.
	* **Album Lock** - Lock individual albums with an additional password.
	* **Custom Album Covers** - Choose your favorite picture within an album and set it as a custom album cover.

	We hope you try and enjoy all our Premium features.

	The KeepSafe Team]]></string>
